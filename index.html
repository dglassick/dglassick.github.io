            Hello, my name is Derek. I am married with one son and another on the way. I currently teach 10th Grade
                English.
                I love to read, play video games, watch movies, and hangout with family and friends. I enjoy
                drinking beer, and have even dabbled in brewing my own.
                Even though I really enjoy teaching, I feel like that career will lead to frustration if I attempt
                to move up to administration.
                I searched for a new career and discovered coding. Through the prework, while I was nervous about
                not picking up enough, I found really enjoyed it, and am looking forward to discovering new ways to code.
